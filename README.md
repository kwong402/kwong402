### Hi, I'm Karen 👋🏼

I'm a apprentice full-stack software developer who is open to work! In the areas of STEM, I have previously taught high school Science and Math. I am now pursuing the track of putting all these areas together to have a deeper understanding and continual learning in this new career. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React.JS, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL.

### What I'm Focusing On 👩🏻‍💻

Currently seeking employment while building more features to my Travel Keep app. Check it out <a href="https://travel-keep.onrender.com" target="_blank">here</a>!
